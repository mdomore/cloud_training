# Phase 1: Foundations - Exercises

## 🚀 Setup Your Environment First!

**Before starting exercises, set up a safe learning environment!**

👉 **Complete Setup Guide**: [../../SETUP_GUIDE.md](../../SETUP_GUIDE.md)

**Quick Summary:**
1. Install VirtualBox (works on macOS and Linux)
2. Download Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS ISO
3. Create a VM with 2GB RAM and 20GB disk
4. Install Ubuntu Server
5. **Create a snapshot** before starting exercises
6. You're ready to learn safely!

**Why use a VM?**
- ✅ Experiment without breaking your system
- ✅ Use snapshots to restore if something goes wrong
- ✅ Perfect isolation for learning Linux
- ✅ Easy to reset and start fresh

**Important**: Always create a snapshot before starting exercises. This allows you to restore if something goes wrong.
