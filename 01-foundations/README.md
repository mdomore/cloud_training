By the end of this phase, you should be able to:
- Understand and manage Linux systems effectively
- Comprehend network protocols and configurations
- Use version control and basic development tools
- Write simple scripts for automation

## Structure

- **[01-system-administration](./01-system-administration/)** - Linux fundamentals, system management, security
- **[02-networking](./02-networking/)** - Network protocols, DNS, routing, security
- **[03-development-basics](./03-development-basics/)** - Git, programming basics, API development

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- Access to a Linux system (physical or virtual)

## Estimated Time

- System Administration: 2-3 weeks
- Networking: 1-2 weeks
- Development Basics: 1-2 weeks

**Total: 4-7 weeks** (depending on your existing knowledge)
