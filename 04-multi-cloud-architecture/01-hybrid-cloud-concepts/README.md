# Hybrid Cloud Concepts

## Purpose

Understand hybrid cloud architectures that combine on-premises infrastructure with cloud resources, and learn how to connect and manage them.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Hybrid Cloud Fundamentals
- What is hybrid cloud
- Use cases and benefits
- Challenges and considerations
- Hybrid vs multi-cloud

### 2. Cloud Connectivity
- **VPN Connections**
  - AWS: Site-to-Site VPN, Client VPN
  - GCP: Cloud VPN
  - Azure: VPN Gateway
- **Dedicated Connections**
  - AWS: Direct Connect
  - GCP: Cloud Interconnect
  - Azure: ExpressRoute
- **Peering** - VPC/VNet peering

### 3. Data Synchronization
- Data replication strategies
- Hybrid storage solutions
- Backup and restore across environments
- Data consistency

### 4. Disaster Recovery
- Backup strategies
- Failover procedures
- Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)
- Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
- Testing disaster recovery

### 5. Cost Optimization
- Cost analysis across environments
- Right-sizing resources
- Reserved instances and savings plans
- Cost monitoring and alerting

## Learning Resources

- Cloud provider hybrid cloud documentation
- Architecture patterns
- Cost optimization guides

## Practical Exercises

1. Set up VPN connection between on-premises and cloud
