# Phase 4: Multi-Cloud Architecture

## Overview

Learn to design and implement architectures that span multiple cloud providers. Understand hybrid cloud concepts, multi-cloud patterns, and how to connect and manage resources across different platforms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you should be able to:
- Design hybrid and multi-cloud architectures
- Connect resources across different cloud providers
- Implement disaster recovery across clouds
- Optimize costs and performance in multi-cloud setups
- Manage identity and networking across clouds

## Structure

- **[01-hybrid-cloud-concepts](./01-hybrid-cloud-concepts/)** - Understanding hybrid cloud connectivity and concepts
- **[02-multi-cloud-patterns](./02-multi-cloud-patterns/)** - Deployment patterns and strategies
- **[03-networking](./03-networking/)** - Networking across cloud providers

## Prerequisites

- Phase 3: Cloud Platforms Deep Dive completed
- Understanding of each cloud provider's networking
- Terraform knowledge for multi-provider setups

## Estimated Time

- Hybrid Cloud Concepts: 2-3 weeks
- Multi-Cloud Patterns: 3-4 weeks
- Networking: 2-3 weeks

**Total: 7-10 weeks**

## Key Concepts

- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combining on-premises and cloud resources
- **Multi-Cloud**: Using multiple cloud providers simultaneously
- **Cloud Connectivity**: VPN, dedicated connections, peering
- **Data Synchronization**: Replication across clouds
- **Disaster Recovery**: Failover strategies
- **Cost Optimization**: Managing costs across providers
