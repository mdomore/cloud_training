# Multi-Cloud Patterns

## Purpose

Learn deployment patterns and strategies for running applications across multiple cloud providers simultaneously.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Deployment Patterns
- **Active-Active**: Application running on all clouds simultaneously
- **Active-Passive**: Primary on one cloud, standby on another
- **Geographic Distribution**: Different regions for different clouds
- **Service-Specific**: Different services on different clouds

### 2. Data Replication Strategies
- Synchronous vs asynchronous replication
- Multi-master replication
- Conflict resolution
- Data consistency models

### 3. Cross-Cloud Load Balancing
- DNS-based load balancing
- Global load balancers
- Health checks across clouds
- Failover mechanisms

### 4. Identity Federation
- Single Sign-On (SSO) across clouds
- OIDC and SAML
- Cross-cloud IAM
- Identity providers

### 5. Application Architecture
- Stateless design for multi-cloud
- Database strategies (replication, sharding)
- Session management
- API gateway patterns

## Learning Resources

- Multi-cloud architecture patterns
- CNCF multi-cloud resources
- Cloud provider multi-cloud guides

## Practical Exercises

1. Deploy an application in active-active mode across AWS and GCP
2. Implement data replication between clouds
3. Set up cross-cloud load balancing
4. Configure identity federation
5. Design a multi-cloud architecture for your application
