# Phase 2: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Overview

Learn to automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration management. This phase covers the tools and practices that enable reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you should be able to:
- Write Ansible playbooks for configuration management
- Provision infrastructure with Terraform across multiple clouds
- Containerize applications with Docker
- Deploy and manage containerized applications with Kubernetes

## Structure

- **[01-configuration-management](./01-configuration-management/)** - Ansible for automated configuration
- **[02-infrastructure-provisioning](./02-infrastructure-provisioning/)** - Terraform/OpenTofu for infrastructure provisioning
- **[03-containerization](./03-containerization/)** - Docker and Kubernetes

## Prerequisites

- Phase 1: Foundations completed
- Understanding of Linux and networking
- Basic scripting knowledge

## Estimated Time

- Configuration Management: 2-3 weeks
- Infrastructure Provisioning: 3-4 weeks
- Containerization: 3-4 weeks

**Total: 8-11 weeks**

## How to Use This Phase

1. Start with configuration management (Ansible)
2. Move to infrastructure provisioning (Terraform)
3. Learn containerization (Docker, then Kubernetes)
4. Practice combining all tools together
5. Document your infrastructure code and patterns
