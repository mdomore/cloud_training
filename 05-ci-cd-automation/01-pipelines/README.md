# CI/CD Pipelines

## Purpose

Learn to create and manage CI/CD pipelines that automate building, testing, and deploying applications across multiple cloud environments.

## Topics Covered

### 1. CI/CD Fundamentals
- Continuous Integration vs Continuous Deployment
- Pipeline concepts and stages
- Best practices
- CI/CD tools comparison

### 2. GitLab CI/CD
- Pipeline configuration (.gitlab-ci.yml)
- Jobs, stages, and artifacts
- Runners (shared, specific, Docker)
- Variables and secrets
- Multi-project pipelines

### 3. GitHub Actions
- Workflow files
- Actions and reusable workflows
- Secrets management
- Matrix strategies
- Environments

### 4. Pipeline Stages
- **Build**: Compile and package applications
- **Test**: Unit, integration, e2e tests
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning, SAST/DAST
- **Deploy**: Multi-environment deployments
- **Post-deploy**: Smoke tests, monitoring

### 5. Multi-Cloud Deployment
- Deploying to AWS, GCP, Azure in same pipeline
- Environment-specific configurations
- Conditional deployments
- Rollback strategies
