# Phase 5: CI/CD & Automation

## Overview

Learn to automate the entire software delivery lifecycle, from code commit to production deployment across multiple cloud environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you should be able to:
- Set up CI/CD pipelines
- Automate infrastructure deployments
- Implement deployment strategies (blue/green, canary)
- Deploy applications to multiple cloud environments automatically
- Integrate security scanning and testing in pipelines

## Structure

- **[01-pipelines](./01-pipelines/)** - CI/CD pipeline setup and configuration
- **[02-automation-tools](./02-automation-tools/)** - Infrastructure and deployment automation

## Prerequisites

- Phase 2: Infrastructure as Code completed
- Phase 3: Cloud Platforms completed
- Git knowledge
- Understanding of application deployment

## Estimated Time

- CI/CD Pipelines: 3-4 weeks
- Automation Tools: 2-3 weeks

**Total: 5-7 weeks**

## Key Concepts

- **Continuous Integration**: Automatically build and test code
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automatically deploy to production
- **Pipeline Stages**: Build, test, security scan, deploy
- **Multi-Environment**: Dev, staging, production
- **Deployment Strategies**: Rolling, blue/green, canary
