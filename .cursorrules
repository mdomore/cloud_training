# Cursor Rules for Cloud Training Documentation

## Documentation Structure Rules

### 1. Content Separation

**Documentation (`docs/` folder):**
- Contains ONLY learning content, explanations, and references
- NO exercises, NO detailed task lists with code blocks
- May contain brief summaries or overviews of exercises with links
- Format: `docs/XX-phase-name.md` (e.g., `docs/01-foundations.md`)

**Exercises (`exercises/` folder):**
- Contains ALL practical exercises, tasks, and hands-on activities
- Questions should be listed WITHOUT answers in the main exercise sections
- Answers should be in a separate "Answers" section at the END of each exercise file
- Format: `exercises/XX-phase-name/YY-topic-name/README.md`

**Examples (`examples/` folder):**
- Contains code examples, sample scripts, and reference implementations
- Should complement both documentation and exercises
- Format: `examples/XX-phase-name/YY-topic-name/`

### 2. Exercise Structure Rules

**Questions Section:**
- List ALL questions together in a "Questions to Answer:" section
- Questions should NOT have answers immediately following them
- Format:
  ```markdown
  ### Questions to Answer:
  
  - Question 1?
  - Question 2?
  - Question 3?
  ```

**Answers Section:**
- Place ALL answers at the END of the exercise file
- Group answers by exercise number/title
- Format:
  ```markdown
  ---
  
  ## Answers
  
  ### Exercise 1: Topic Name
  
  - **Question 1?**
    📚 **Answer**: See [Documentation Link](#link)
  
  - **Question 2?**
    📚 **Answer**: See [Documentation Link](#link)
  ```

**Rationale:**
- Students should attempt to answer questions first
- Answers are available but require scrolling to the end
- Encourages active learning and thinking before checking answers

### 3. Documentation Content Rules

**What belongs in `docs/`:**
- ✅ Learning objectives
- ✅ Conceptual explanations
- ✅ Command references and examples (for learning)
- ✅ Configuration examples
- ✅ Best practices
- ✅ Links to exercises (but not the exercises themselves)
- ✅ Links to examples (but not the examples themselves)

**What does NOT belong in `docs/`:**
- ❌ Full exercise tasks with step-by-step instructions
- ❌ Exercise questions
- ❌ Exercise answers
- ❌ Complete project implementations (these go in examples/)

### 4. Exercise Content Rules

**What belongs in `exercises/`:**
- ✅ Task lists with instructions
- ✅ Step-by-step commands to practice
- ✅ Questions to answer (without answers)
- ✅ Challenge scenarios
- ✅ Deliverables and requirements
- ✅ Links to relevant documentation sections

**What does NOT belong in `exercises/`:**
- ❌ Answers immediately after questions (answers go at the end)
- ❌ Full documentation content (reference docs instead)

### 5. File Organization Rules

**Documentation Files:**
- One main file per phase: `docs/XX-phase-name.md`
- Use consistent heading hierarchy (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
- Include Table of Contents at the top
- Link to exercises and examples, don't duplicate them

**Exercise Files:**
- One README.md per exercise topic
- Structure: Tasks → Questions (no answers) → Answers (at end)
- Include links to relevant documentation sections

**Example Files:**
- Organize by phase and topic
- Include README.md explaining what the examples demonstrate
- Reference in both docs and exercises

### 6. Code Block Rules

**In Documentation:**
- Use code blocks to show HOW commands work
- Include explanations of what each command does
- These are learning examples, not exercises

**In Exercises:**
- Use code blocks for tasks students should complete
- Include placeholders or incomplete examples for students to fill
- Provide complete solutions only in the Answers section or examples/

### 7. Link Structure

**From Documentation to Exercises:**
```markdown
**📝 Complete exercises in:** [exercises/XX-phase-name/YY-topic-name/](../../exercises/XX-phase-name/YY-topic-name/)
```

**From Exercises to Documentation:**
```markdown
📚 **Answer**: See [Section Name](../../../docs/XX-phase-name.md#section-anchor)
```

**From Exercises to Examples:**
```markdown
**💡 Reference examples in:** [examples/XX-phase-name/YY-topic-name/](../../../examples/XX-phase-name/YY-topic-name/)
```

### 8. Answer Format Rules

**In Exercise Files:**
- Answers MUST be in a separate "Answers" section at the end
- Answers should be grouped by exercise
- Each answer should link to the relevant documentation section
- Format:
  ```markdown
  - **Question text?**
    📚 **Answer**: See [Documentation Section](../../../docs/file.md#anchor)
  ```

**Never:**
- Place answers immediately after questions
- Mix questions and answers in the same list
- Put answers in the documentation files

### 9. Heading Consistency

**Documentation Headings:**
- `##` for main sections (e.g., "Linux Fundamentals")
- `###` for subsections (e.g., "1. File System Hierarchy")
- `####` for detailed topics
- Ensure unique headings to avoid TOC conflicts

**Exercise Headings:**
- `##` for exercise titles (e.g., "Exercise 1: Topic")
- `###` for sections within exercises (e.g., "Tasks:", "Questions to Answer:")
- `##` for the "Answers" section at the end

### 10. When Adding New Content

**Before adding to docs/:**
- Is this learning content or an exercise?
- If it's an exercise, put it in exercises/
- If it's an example, put it in examples/
- Only put conceptual/educational content in docs/

**Before adding to exercises/:**
- Are questions separated from answers?
- Are answers at the end of the file?
- Are there links to relevant documentation?

**Before adding to examples/:**
- Is this a complete, working example?
- Does it complement the documentation?
- Is it referenced from docs or exercises?

## Quick Reference Checklist

When editing files, verify:

- [ ] Documentation is in `docs/`, not mixed with exercises
- [ ] Exercises are in `exercises/`, with questions separate from answers
- [ ] Answers are at the END of exercise files, not inline
- [ ] Examples are in `examples/`, referenced but not duplicated
- [ ] Links between docs, exercises, and examples are correct
- [ ] No exercise content in documentation files
- [ ] No documentation content in exercise files (only references)

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When helping with this codebase:

1. **Always check location first**: Is the content going to the right folder?
2. **Separate questions from answers**: Never put answers immediately after questions in exercises
3. **Link, don't duplicate**: Reference content instead of copying it
4. **Maintain structure**: Follow the established patterns for headings, links, and organization
5. **Verify separation**: Before committing, ensure docs/, exercises/, and examples/ are properly separated
