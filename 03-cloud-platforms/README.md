# Phase 3: Cloud Platforms Deep Dive

## Overview

Deep dive into the three major cloud providers: AWS, GCP, and Azure. Learn their core services, understand their differences, and build proficiency across all three platforms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you should be able to:
- Understand and use core services of AWS, GCP, and Azure
- Provision resources using Terraform for each platform
- Understand the differences and similarities between providers
- Make informed decisions about which services to use

## Structure

- **[01-aws](./01-aws/)** - Amazon Web Services
- **[02-gcp](./02-gcp/)** - Google Cloud Platform
- **[03-azure](./03-azure/)** - Microsoft Azure

## Prerequisites

- Phase 2: Infrastructure as Code completed
- Terraform knowledge
- Cloud provider accounts (free tiers available)

## Estimated Time

- AWS: 3-4 weeks
- GCP: 3-4 weeks
- Azure: 3-4 weeks

**Total: 9-12 weeks**

## Learning Strategy

1. Learn each platform systematically
2. Compare similar services across platforms
3. Practice with Terraform for each provider
4. Build small projects on each platform
5. Document differences and use cases

## Service Categories to Cover

For each cloud provider, learn:
- **Compute** - Virtual machines, containers, serverless
- **Storage** - Object storage, block storage, file storage
- **Networking** - VPC, load balancing, DNS, CDN
- **Databases** - Managed databases (SQL and NoSQL)
- **Security** - IAM, encryption, compliance
- **Monitoring** - Logging, metrics, alerting
