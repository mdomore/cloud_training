# Cloud Security

## Purpose

Learn security best practices for cloud infrastructure, including identity management, secrets management, network security, and security scanning.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- IAM principles (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Service accounts and service principals
- Least privilege principle
- IAM policies and best practices

### 2. Secrets Management

- **Azure Key Vault**: Azure secrets and keys
- Secrets rotation
- Best practices

### 3. Network Security
- Security groups and network ACLs
- Firewall rules
- DDoS protection
- Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- Network segmentation

### 4. Data Encryption
- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit (TLS/SSL)
- Key management
- Certificate management

### 5. Security Scanning
- **Trivy**: Container and infrastructure scanning
- **Clair**: Container vulnerability scanner
- **Snyk**: Dependency scanning
- SAST/DAST tools
- Infrastructure scanning

### 6. Security Monitoring
- Security event logging
- Intrusion detection
- Anomaly detection
- Security information and event management (SIEM)

## Learning Resources

- Cloud provider security documentation
- OWASP cloud security
- Security best practices guides
