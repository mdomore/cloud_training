# Phase 8: Application Development

## Overview

Learn to design and develop cloud-native applications that can run efficiently across multiple cloud providers. Understand microservices architecture, API design, and deployment patterns.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you should be able to:
- Design cloud-native applications
- Implement microservices architecture
- Develop RESTful APIs
- Deploy applications using containers and orchestration
- Design for multi-cloud portability

## Structure

- **[01-cloud-native-design](./01-cloud-native-design/)** - Application architecture and design principles
- **[02-deployment](./02-deployment/)** - Application deployment patterns and tools

## Prerequisites

- Phase 2: Infrastructure as Code completed
- Phase 3: Cloud Platforms completed
- Development basics from Phase 1
- Understanding of containers and Kubernetes

## Estimated Time

- Cloud-Native Design: 2-3 weeks
- Deployment: 2-3 weeks

**Total: 4-6 weeks**

## Key Concepts

- **12-Factor App**: Best practices for cloud applications
- **Microservices**: Distributed application architecture
- **API-First**: Design APIs before implementation
- **Stateless Design**: Applications without server-side state
- **Multi-Cloud Portability**: Design for cloud-agnostic deployment
