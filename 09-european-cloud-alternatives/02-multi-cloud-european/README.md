# Multi-Cloud with European Providers

## Purpose

Learn to replicate your multi-cloud architecture using European cloud providers and design hybrid architectures combining US and European clouds.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Replicating Architecture
- Porting AWS/GCP/Azure architecture to European clouds
- Service mapping and alternatives
- Architecture adaptation
- Testing and validation

### 2. Hybrid US/EU Scenarios
- Combining US clouds (AWS/GCP/Azure) with European clouds
- Data residency requirements
- Cross-continent connectivity
- Latency considerations

### 3. Data Sovereignty
- What is data sovereignty
- GDPR requirements
- Data localization
- Compliance considerations
- Data transfer regulations

### 4. Compliance
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation
- Data processing agreements
- Data residency requirements
- Compliance frameworks
- Audit and reporting

### 5. Architecture Patterns
- EU-only deployment
- US/EU hybrid deployment
- Data replication strategies
- Disaster recovery across continents

## Learning Resources

- GDPR documentation
- Data sovereignty guides
- European cloud architecture patterns
- Compliance frameworks

## Practical Exercises

1. Replicate your application on European clouds
2. Design a hybrid US/EU architecture
3. Implement data sovereignty controls
4. Set up cross-continent connectivity
5. Create compliance documentation
6. Test disaster recovery scenarios

## Notes

Document your learnings:
- Architecture diagrams
