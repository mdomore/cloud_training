# Distributed Tracing

## Purpose

Learn to trace requests across distributed systems and microservices to understand application performance and troubleshoot issues.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Tracing Fundamentals
- What is distributed tracing
- Spans and traces
- Trace context propagation
- Sampling strategies

### 2. Tracing Tools
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing platform
- **Zipkin**: Distributed tracing system
- **OpenTelemetry**: Observability framework
- Cloud provider tracing (X-Ray, Cloud Trace, Application Insights)

### 3. Instrumentation
- Application instrumentation
- Auto-instrumentation
- Manual instrumentation
- Context propagation

### 4. Trace Analysis
- Trace visualization
- Performance analysis
- Error detection
- Dependency mapping

### 5. Multi-Cloud Tracing
- Cross-cloud trace correlation
- Unified trace visualization
- Performance monitoring across clouds

## Learning Resources
