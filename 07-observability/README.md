# Phase 7: Observability

## Overview

Learn to monitor, log, and trace applications and infrastructure across multiple cloud environments. Understand how to gain visibility into system behavior and performance.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you should be able to:
- Set up comprehensive monitoring across clouds
- Aggregate and analyze logs from multiple sources
- Implement distributed tracing
- Create effective alerting strategies
- Troubleshoot issues using observability data

## Structure

- **[01-monitoring](./01-monitoring/)** - Metrics collection and monitoring
- **[02-logging](./02-logging/)** - Centralized logging
- **[03-tracing](./03-tracing/)** - Distributed tracing

## Prerequisites

- Phase 3: Cloud Platforms completed
- Applications deployed to cloud
- Understanding of system metrics and logs

## Estimated Time

- Monitoring: 2-3 weeks
- Logging: 2-3 weeks
- Tracing: 1-2 weeks

**Total: 5-8 weeks**

## Key Concepts

- **Three Pillars of Observability**: Metrics, Logs, Traces
- **Monitoring**: Real-time system health
- **Logging**: Event records
- **Tracing**: Request flow across services
- **Alerting**: Notifications on anomalies
